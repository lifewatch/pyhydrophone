pyhydrophone
============

Description
-----------
pyhydrophone helps keeping together all the information of the recorder.
It makes it easier to read different hydrophones' output files and extract the information.

Each class represents a different hydrophone. The available ones now are (others will be added):

* SoundTrap (OceanInstruments)
* Seiche (Seiche)
* AMAR (JASCO)
* RESEA (RTSys)
* uPAM (Seiche)
* EARS
* MTE AURAL (MTE)


They all inherit from the main class Hydrophone.
If a certain recorder provides an output different than a regular wav file, functions to read and understand the output
are provided.
Functions to read the metadata are also provided (which is often encoded in the file name).
